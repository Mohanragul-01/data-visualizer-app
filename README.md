# Data Visualization App

This is a data visualization app built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications, along with other powerful libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visually appealing plots.

## Features

- Sample datasets: The app provides built-in sample datasets for users to explore without needing to upload their own data.
- Multiple visualization options: Users can choose from a variety of visualization types including line plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more.
- Ready-to-use: The app comes pre-configured with default settings, eliminating the need for customization and allowing users to quickly generate visualizations.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mohanragul-01/data-visualizer-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd data-visualizer-app
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command:

```
